For each of the three ideas, provide two things:
1. A short, user-friendly phrase (3-5 words) that summarizes the theme (e.g., "Warm & Rustic," "Sleek & Modern," "Outdoor Adventure"). This will be shown to the user.
2. A detailed, single-sentence prompt that can be fed directly into an image generation model. This prompt should encapsulate the scene, lighting, and mood (e.g., "A close-up of the product on a rustic wooden surface, with soft, natural light filtering in from a nearby window, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.").

Based on the photo provided, generate three such ideas, each with a shortPhrase and a detailedPrompt.
