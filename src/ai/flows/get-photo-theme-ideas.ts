    prompt: `You are a professional product photographer and creative director. I will provide you with a product photo. Based on the productâ€™s appearance, design, and likely target audience, generate three creative product photography ideas that a seller could use to promote this item.

For each of the three ideas, provide a concise, single-sentence prompt that can be fed directly into an image generation model. This prompt should encapsulate the scene, lighting, and mood.

For example, if the idea is for a watch on a wooden table, the prompt might be: "A close-up of the product on a rustic wooden surface, with soft, natural light filtering in from a nearby window, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere."

Based on the photo provided, generate three such prompts.

Photo: {{media url=photoDataUri}}`,
