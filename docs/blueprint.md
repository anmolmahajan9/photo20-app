# **App Name**: PicPerfect Products

## Core Features:

- Image Input: Users can upload a product photo or take a picture directly within the app.
- Theme Selection: Users can choose from a variety of pre-set themes (e.g., 'studio lighting,' 'outdoor') to re-imagine their product photo. These themes will be converted into carefully crafted prompts for the image model.
- AI Theme Generation: If desired, users can additionally enter a description to generate prompts, specifying desired styles and settings for the generated product photo. This app leverages the Gemini 'nano banana' model ('gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview') to create these renderings, incorporating a set of 'tool' prompts behind the scenes.
- Image Rendering: Generates the product photo using Gemini based on the selected theme, prompt from user descriptions, or combination of both.
- Photo Display: Presents the newly rendered product photo to the user.
- Download Option: Offers users a button for downloading the generated image to their device.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to give a sense of trust and stability. The user should feel assured when they are using AI technology.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F2F5) for the light theme, nearly black (#1A1A1A) for the dark theme. Provides a clean and neutral backdrop to help highlight the product images, and accomodates either a light or dark overall scheme, as per the user request. The background is approximately the same hue as the primary, but much less saturated.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), an analogous hue to the blue, and chosen for its contrast in brightness and saturation, to draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Body: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. Headings: 'Playfair', serif. Using Playfair as headings, paired with PT Sans for body will lend a high end feel.
- Clean, modern icons that are easily understandable.
- Simple and intuitive layout to focus the user on the product image.
- Subtle transitions and animations to create a smooth user experience.
